## [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

It was decided to use MongoDB, as it is better suited based on the program specification. This database is perfectly suited
for the document-oriented data type, which is the main one for this project

## The problems of similar messengers

The problem of similar messengers is the lack of guarantees that your company will NOT be disconnected from the servers, thereby undermining the reliability of communication of your employees, which is a very important part.
